 * The panel this package's resources need in order to be resources at all.

 * The package ships a plugin and the application composes the panel, so the
 * suite composes the smallest panel that attaches the plugin — under the `admin`
 * id `module.json`'s `presentation.filament` key names, which is the composition
 * this repository is actually claiming works.
 *
 * Deliberately not tenant-aware. The plugin must work on a panel with no
 * tenancy, because nothing in the manifest says the host's panel has any.
